## Dependencies
The current version uses the `open` command to open urls in google, or in the browser. If you dont have this command, you can replace it with something similar. Maybe `rifle` or `firefox` or something like that?

## Adding/modifying shortcuts
Simply add shortcuts/commands by editing the dictionary at the beginning of `tickle.py`
